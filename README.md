Minitalk

Minitalk is a low-level systems programming project from the 42 curriculum that focuses on inter-process communication in a UNIX environment.
The project explores how independent programs can exchange information reliably using operating system primitives rather than high-level abstractions.

The project reinforces key systems programming concepts such as signal handling, process lifecycle management, and robust error handling. It requires writing precise, defensive code capable of handling asynchronous events without compromising stability or performance.

Minitalk serves as an introduction to low-level communication mechanisms, helping bridge the gap between application-level logic and operating system behavior — an essential step toward more advanced projects involving concurrency, networking, or distributed systems.
